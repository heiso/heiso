### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

I have been a developer for over 10 years, first as a frontend and then as a backend in the AdTech industry until 2018. I improved my skills during my last full-time experience at Comet as a Lead Developer until 2022.

I am now specialized in Typescript and code architecture, and have a keen interest in security, DevOps, and product issues.
I had the opportunity to do a lot of R&D on GraphQL and end-to-end typing during my last two experiences.

I have been a strong believer in remote work for over 3 years and have often worked on the move, either abroad or in France.

In my free time, I like to learn new ways of creating, whether it's embedded code, woodworking, or small electronic projects.

### ðŸ’» Some coding conventions I like
