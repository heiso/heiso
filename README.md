### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

I have been a developer for over 11 years and a strong believer in remote work for over 3 years and have often worked on the move, either abroad or in France.

In my free time, I like to learn new ways of creating, whether it's embedded code, woodworking, or small electronic projects.

### ðŸ’» Some coding conventions I like

- [Rule of three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming))
- [Stop trying to be so DRY, instead Write Everything Twice (WET)](https://dev.to/wuz/stop-trying-to-be-so-dry-instead-write-everything-twice-wet-5g33)
- [The wrong abstraction](https://sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction)
- [Clever Code Considered Harmful](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/career/clever-code-considered-harmful/)
